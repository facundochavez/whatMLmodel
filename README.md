# whatMLmodel

*whatMLmodel* lets you use AI to find machine learning models from a quick description of your dataset. You'll get a recommendation thread for each problem, and you can save these analyses by logging in. It's an open-source project aiming to become the top library for students learning the basics and pros who need some organization to experiment with new models. If you're a developer or have technical/theoretical knowledge of ML, join us!
